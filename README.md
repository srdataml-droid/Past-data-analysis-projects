Insights:

Comedy dominates views and engagement (likes/comments/shares), despite not being the highest in video count.

Food has the highest number of videos (57), but views are slightly lower than Comedy.

Travel has the lowest views and engagement, even though its video count isn’t the smallest.

Lifestyle videos are short (1,280s total), yet engagement is still strong relative to duration.

2️⃣ Highest vs. Lowest Views (Top 10)

Top-performing Comedy video: vid_1297 – 486,008 views

Top-performing Food video: vid_1298 – 499,401 views (highest overall)

Top-performing Education video: vid_1294 – 488,462 views

Lowest views: Some videos barely hit 1,404–5,809 views (vid_1203, vid_1005, vid_1011).

Observation: Highest-view videos are fairly recent uploads (vid_12xx series), suggesting newer content is attracting more attention.

3️⃣ Duration vs. Engagement

Videos over 200,000 seconds in cumulative category duration (Comedy, Tech) tend to have higher views, but not linearly.

Some short-duration videos (Lifestyle) still perform well — indicating content quality & topic relevance matters more than duration.

4️⃣ Engagement per View

We can estimate engagement efficiency (likes + comments + shares ÷ views):

Comedy: 1,375,320 + 153,927 + 60,113 ÷ 14,410,062 ≈ 10.7% engagement rate

Education: 1,319,635 + 142,806 + 53,718 ÷ 11,899,202 ≈ 12.7% engagement rate

Observation: Education videos are punching above their weight in engagement, despite lower total views.

5️⃣ Upload Timing

Sum of upload_hour shows Comedy videos mostly around hour 709, Tech around 583, etc.

If we normalize by video count, we can find peak upload hours by category — useful for planning future uploads.

6️⃣ Key Takeaways

Comedy & Food = high-volume and high-view categories → continue investing here.

Education & Tech = lower views but high engagement → focus on improving visibility while keeping quality.

Lifestyle & Travel = potential for growth → experiment with trends, collaborations, or shorter, punchy content.


Top-performing videos tend to cluster in recent uploads → fresh content gets noticed faster.

Short but high-value videos still generate engagement → don’t rely solely on video length.
